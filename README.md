*NLP-Based Word Prediction Game*

# Project Overview

This project is an interactive NLP-based word prediction game inspired by the classic Hangman concept. The system selects a word from a predefined dataset, provides a hint, and allows the user to guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts.

# Problem Statement

Learning NLP concepts can be abstract without practical applications. This project demonstrates how text handling and prediction logic can be applied in a simple, interactive game format to improve understanding of NLP fundamentals.

# Solution Approach

A dataset of words and corresponding hints is defined

A word is randomly selected and displayed as blanks

Users guess letters based on the hint provided

Correct guesses reveal letters, while wrong guesses reduce attempts

The game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out

# Technologies Used

Python

Basic NLP concepts

Google Colab

# Key Features

Interactive command-line gameplay

Hint-based word prediction

Letter tracking and attempt management

Simple and explainable NLP logic

# How to Run the Project

Clone or download the repository

Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Run the cells and follow the on-screen instructions to play the game

# Results

The game successfully predicts and reveals words based on user input, demonstrating effective text handling and logical flow in an NLP-based application.

# Future Enhancements

Expand the dataset with more words and categories

Add difficulty levels

Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI)

Apply advanced NLP models for smarter predictions
